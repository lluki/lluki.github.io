 <h2>9.10.2020: Devicetree usage in Linux</h2>
 <h2>30.6.2020: The I2C bus driver specification </h2>

Recently we started working with Jan Sch√§r (who writes a bachelor thesis) 
to develop a formal model of I2C. Why would we do such a thing?

Microkernels run drivers in userspace. This isolates, from a memory
perspective, the device driver: It will not be able to access
memory not explicitly assigned to the driver. 
(However, this is not quite
enough, because the driver is in control of hardware, which in turn
might maliciously affect the rest of the system. An example of such a
privilege escalation is the DMA attack.)
Since we partition on memory granularity, this works fine for memory
mapped devices. But in a modern system, many devices are actually 
<b>not</b> memory mapped. For example, USB devices or, I2C attached devices,
or also SD cards (a SD host controller can talk to multiple cards).
To such devices, a driver communicates using a <b>intermediary</b>. Obviously
this intermediary 

We choose I2C because it is critical (controls voltage regulators) and
- through the presence of non standard conforming devices - is hard to programs
and master drivers are riddled with "quirks" and special purpose flags 
to communicate with a non-conforming device.

Furthermore, depending on how much logic is built in hardware
(or, if the intermediary runs in userspace in a monolithic system, the API)
the backend of the intermediary varies greatly and ranges from electrical
signals (for bit-banging I2C) up to SMBus transactions (for example a linux
driver for a SMBus device). 

This combination of non-conforming devices and differing APIs an intermediary
could use, we decided to develop layered model. In this way: We can a)
reason about non-conforming devices and b) reason about intermediaries that
use different backends.

<h2>9.1.2020: Writing a usdhc driver for the colibri board</h2>
<p>We are getting ready to run our advanced operating systems course
next semester on a new ARMv8 board, specifically on the
<a href="https://www.toradex.com/computer-on-modules/colibri-arm-family">Colibri
iMX8x</a>. To let the students focus on interesting projects,
such as writing a file system, we give them some libraries to interact with
the hardware. So I went on to write a SD host controller and card driver.</p>

<p>The iMX8X Datasheet states the host controller is SDHC standard compatible,
and assumed that we can use the standard driver that follows the SDHC standard.
After some fiddling, it dawned on me, that I must be talking to a different
device, despite having some overlap with the standard: For example the host
capability register looked meaningful. After checking which driver our
bootloader U-Boot uses (fsl_esdhc.c), I realized that the host controller is
quite different from the standard. Following the register descriptions of the
IMX8X manual made more sense and I successfully communicated with the host and
performed a card reset procedure. Apart from the reset, I was unable to run
anything that interacts with the SD card. I assumed it was some error with the
clock or power setup. But none of the relevant settings (such as prescaler,
divisor, clock enable etc.) seemed to change anything. So I gave up on
reading the datasheet and instrumented the bootloader to print a register
access trace. Finally, I found the missing bit: U-Boot set
some bits in the "vendor specific" register that are, according to the
datasheet reserved. After setting the same bits as U-Boot, suddenly
card transactions started to work!</p>

<p>Some future work items for improving the driver:
<ul>
    <li>The card detection pin is wired to a GPIO pin, not the proper
        card detection pin. Whether a card is present or not can be
        easily detected, the transactions will time out. However, it's
        hard to get an interrupt on card insertion.</li>
    <li>Optimize it for speed (we never leave the legacy 40MHz clock setting)</li>
    <li>The internal eMMC card works slightly differently than SD cards,
        adapting the driver to that would be handy, then we don't 
        have to give students a SD card.</li>
</ul>
